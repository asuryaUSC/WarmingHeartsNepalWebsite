    <h2 class="sub-heading">Empowering the Lowest Caste with Nutrition and Education</h2>
    <p class="post-text">The Musahar community, considered one of the lowest Dalit (low caste) groups in Nepal, endures immense hardship due to their marginalized status in society. Living in poverty-stricken conditions, they face numerous challenges, including limited access to education, land ownership, and proper nutrition. Warming Hearts Nepal recognizes their plight and is committed to making a difference through a dedicated mid-day meal program. By providing nutritious meals, we aim to empower Musahar children with the nourishment and opportunities they need to thrive.</p>
    <h3 class="sub-sub-heading">Life Challenges for the Musahar Community</h3>
    <p class="post-text">Musahar families live in multi-generational households, often with limited land ownership. Many work as agricultural laborers and fishermen, while women engage in unskilled labor such as stitching leaf plates. Education is undervalued within their community, resulting in alarmingly low literacy rates of 2-6%. Poverty and societal factors often lead to high drop-out rates among Musahar children. Despite attempts at development programs, limited resources reach them, leaving them without proper infrastructure, clothing, and basic amenities.</p>
    <h3 class="sub-sub-heading">A Glimpse into Their Lives</h3>
    <p class="post-text">Musahar families endure immense hardships as they struggle to earn a living. Their houses are made of mud, lacking proper doors and windows. Open kitchens outside their homes are commonplace, while access to toilets remains a luxury. Many work for wealthy landlords, receiving grains as payment. Lack of proper clothing, mattresses, and blankets are everyday challenges they face.</p>
    <h4 class="sub-sub-heading">The Impact of Warming Hearts Nepal's Mid-Day Meal Program</h3>
    <p class="post-text">The Musahar community rarely receives well-balanced and nutritious meals at home. For most children, our mid-day meal program offers the first substantial meal of the day. By introducing this program, we aim to increase school attendance and foster overall improvements in the health and academic performance of these students. Access to proper nutrition will play a pivotal role in encouraging children to attend school and enable them to develop their abilities to their full potential.</p>
    <h3 class="sub-sub-heading">The Urgency for Support</h3>
    <p class="post-text">The reality of Musahar children eating plain rice without vegetables or lentils tugs at our hearts. Warming Hearts Nepal is committed to providing a "big meal of the day" for 140 students at the Martyr Pramod Memorial Pre Primary School in Mirzapur, Siraha District. We invite you to be a part of this initiative and contribute towards bringing smiles to the faces of Musahar children in Siraha.</p>
