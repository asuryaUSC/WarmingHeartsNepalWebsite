        <p class="home-description">
          Warming Hearts Nepal is a non-profit organization committed to enriching the lives of those in need in Nepal. As a community-led initiative, we focus on three primary areas – cancer relief, education, and nutrition support. Our roots are firmly placed in our belief of 'Community First'. Through the dedicated efforts of our team and volunteers, we aim to bring measurable, sustainable changes to the lives of many. Our cancer relief program focuses on providing medical aid and emotional support to the patients battling this harsh disease. Our educational initiatives aim to foster a nurturing learning environment for children in need, thereby providing them with the tools to break the cycle of poverty. Our nutrition support program focuses on providing wholesome meals to those who struggle to have a decent meal. Join us as we strive to warm the hearts of those in need.
